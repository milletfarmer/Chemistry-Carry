# Chemistry-Carry
This repository will include everything needed to solve any "plug and chug" type problem in the AP Chemistry course. 

As a student in AP Chemistry, I find these things a waste of time so I wanted to make a program to solve this issue. I also want to practice my GitHub skills. Cheers.
